/**
 * PartKey object for faster model part ID comparison.
 * A part will be represented by partKeys, including in formats and render.
 * Finding the correct value for a key, if the key is a unique integer, is faster than doing the same with string hashing compare.
 * <p>
 * Usage: Instead of comparing for a string key, store a static final PartKey for the given part in your class, and compare (key) for that.
 * <br>
 * Common part static keys are also available in this class, but you can request your own.
 *
 * @apiNote
 * If two PartKey objects are different, their key must be different: instance comparison is safe for part key equality check.
 * partKeyA == partKeyB is completely safe and okay to do.
 *
 * @implNote Please be aware that with Project Valhalla, the implementation of this class may change, but the behaviour and public functions must not.
